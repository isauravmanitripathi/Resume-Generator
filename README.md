# I Need A Resume

Me and some of my friends were tired of paying for resume services. We wanted to create our own resume service that was affordable and easy to use. You just bring your own api keys and we'll handle the rest.

We have just started to work on this, so expect a lot of changes and updates.

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project
npx sv create my-app
```

To recreate this project with the same configuration:

```sh
# recreate this project
bun x sv create --template minimal --types ts --install bun resume-architect
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
